# Background

Queues around HKU can get quite long. The rush hours queues in and out of the HKU MTR station can reach upward of 10-15 minutes, and so can the queues at HKUâ€™s various restaurants.

It would be convenient if there was a website or something where people could see the approximate waiting time / 
the best time to join the queues so they can decide when to join a queue without having to come see it in person. They can also use it to find out which place has the shortest queues 
(e.g. which MTR exit to go to, which restaurants to avoid).
